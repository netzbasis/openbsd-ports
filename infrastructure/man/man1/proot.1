.Sh NAME
.Nm proot
.Nd ports chroot builder
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm proot
.Bk -words
.Op Fl B Ar chroot
.Op Fl c Ar configfile
.Op Fl S Ar srcroot
.Op Ar key Ns = Ns Ar value ...
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
can fill up a chroot directory for ports building usage.
It will perform a set of
.Cm actions
that should fill up a destination
.Fl B Ar chroot
from the base system
.Po
or an optional
.Fl S Ar srcroot
.Pc .
.Pp
As far as possible,
.Nm
will create hardlinks instead of copying files, so that cloning an existing
chroot will often only consume i-nodes.
.Pp
Attribute values can be specified on the command line
.Ar key Ns = Ns Ar value .
Some attribute take several values.
As a shorthand, several values can be specified in a row without having
to repeat the
.Ar key ,
for instance:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
.Nm Fl B Ar /build Ar actions Ns = Ns Ar unpopulate_light Ar check_symlinks
.Ed
.Pp
A
.Fl c Ar configfile
mostly contains one key=value per line, with comments starting
with a #.
.Pp
Possible actions (in order of execution) are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Dssssssssssss -compact -offset indent
.It Cm check_mount
Verify the state of mount points in the system, specifically whether
the chroot area is not nodev.

.Pc
or other mountpoints.
.It Cm snapshot
Copy things from a
.Ar snapshot ,
to retrieve from an url, or from the local filesystem
.It Cm locate
Copy things from the base system, perusing the system locate databases.
.It Cm resolv
Copy the system

and
.Pa hosts

.It Cm unpopulate_light
Remove everything from the chroot, apart from known preserved areas
.Po marked with
.Ar preserve
.Pc
or other mountpoints,
and stuff copied over during
.Cm locate ,
.Cm snapshot
or
.Cm resolv .
.It Cm devs
Regenerate devices using
.Xr MAKEDEV 8
.It Cm ldconfig
Rerun
.Xr ldconfig 8
.It Cm copy_ports
Copy the ports tree
.It Cm checkout_ports
Check out a ports tree from cvs using a provided
.Ar portscvs
location .
.It Cm copy_sys
Copy system include files (deprecated).
.It Cm ports_subdirs
Create ports infrastructure subdirs, according to users required for
.Xr dpb 1 .
If
.Ar chown_all
is set to 1,
.Xr chown 2
any content within to the appropriate users.
.It Cm stragglers
Double-check filled up chroot for files we don't know about.
.It Cm write_mk
If some directory values are different from the default,
write a skeleton
.Pa mk.conf
file.
.It Cm check_symlinks
Report absolute symlinks that exist under the
.Ar chroot ,
white-listing known base system links.
.El
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
will run
.Cm check_mount , devs , ldconfig , ports_subdirs , resolv , write_mk .
It will also run
.Cm snapshot
if a snapshot location is provided,
or
.Cm locate
otherwise.
.Pp
Add actions with
.Ar actions Ns = Ns value ,
remove them with
.Ar actions Ns = Ns - Ns value .
.Pp
Other attributes are:
.Bl -tag -width Dssssssssss -offset indent -compact
.It Ar chroot
same as
.Fl B Ar chroot
.It Ar srcroot
same as
.Fl S Ar srcroot
.It Ar PORT_USER
Who the ports tree should belong to
.It Ar BUILD_USER
Who to build as (defaults to _pbuild)
.It Ar FETCH_USER
Who to fetch as (defaults to _pfetch)
.It Ar LOG_USER
Who to write log as
.Po
defaults to
.Ar BUILD_USER
.Pc
.It Ar PORTSDIR
.It Ar DISTDIR
.It Ar PACKAGE_REPOSITORY
.It Ar PLIST_DB
.It Ar LOCKDIR
.It Ar WRKOBJDIR

.It Ar chown_all
set to 1 to have action
.Cm ports_subdirs
change owners of every content.
.It Ar key
Name of a
.Xr signify 1
signing key.

in generated
.Pa /etc/mk.conf
accordingly.
.It Ar preserve
