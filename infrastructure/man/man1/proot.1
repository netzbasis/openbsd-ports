.Sh NAME
.Nm proot
.Nd ports chroot builder
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm proot
.Bk -words
.Op Fl B Ar chroot
.Op Fl c Ar configfile
.Op Fl S Ar srcroot
.Op Ar key Ns = Ns Ar value ...
.Ek
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
can fill up a chroot directory for ports building usage.
It will perform a set of
.Cm actions
that should fill up a destination
.Ar chroot
from the base system
.Po
or an optional
.Fl S Ar srcroot
.Pc .
.Pp
As far as possible,
.Nm
will create hardlinks instead of copying files, so that cloning an existing
chroot will often only consume i-nodes.
.Pp
Attribute values can be specified on the command line
.Ar key Ns = Ns Ar value .
Some attribute take several values.
As a shorthand, several values can be specified in a row without having
to repeat the
.Ar key .
.Pp
A config file mostly contains one key=value per line, with comments starting
with a #.
.Pp
Possible actions (in order of execution) are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Cm check_mount
Verify the state of mount points in the system, specifically whether
the chroot area is not nodev.
.It Cm unpopulate
Remove everything from the chroot, apart from known preserved areas
.Po marked with
.Ar preserve
.Pc
or other mountpoints.
.It Cm snapshot
Copy things from a
.Ar snapshot ,
to retrieve from an url, or from the local filesystem
.It Cm locate
Copy things from the base system, perusing the system locate databases.
.It Cm resolv
Copy the system
.Pa resolv.conf
file
.It Cm devs
Regenerate devices using
.Xr MAKEDEV 8
.It Cm ldconfig
Rerun 
.Xr ldconfig 8
.It Cm copy_ports
Copy the ports tree
.It Cm checkout_ports
Check out a ports tree from cvs using a provided
.Ar portscvs
location .
.It Cm copy_sys
Copy system include files (deprecated).
.It Cm ports_subdirs
Create ports infrastructure subdirs, according to users required for
.Xr dpb 1 .
.It Cm stragglers
Double-check filled up chroot for files we don't know about.
.It Cm write_mk
If some directory values are different from the default, 
write a skeleton
.Pa mk.conf
file.
.El
.Pp
By default,
.Nm
will run
.Cm check_mount , devs , ldconfig , ports_subdirs , resolv , write_mk .
It will also run
.Cm snapshot
if a snapshot location is provided,
or
.Cm locate
otherwise.
.Pp
Add actions with
.Ar actions Ns = Ns value ,
remove them with
.Ar actions Ns = Ns - Ns value .
.Pp
Other attributes are
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.It Ar chroot
same as
.Fl B Ar chroot
.It Ar srcroot
same as
.Fl S Ar srcroot
.It Ar PORT_USER
Who the ports tree should belong to (we always use _pbuild and _pfetch
for the build and fetch stage).
.It Ar PORTSDIR
.It Ar DISTDIR
.It Ar PACKAGE_REPOSITORY
.It Ar PLIST_DB
.It Ar LOCKDIR
same as in
.Xr bsd.port.mk 5
.It Ar preserve
Supplemental directory to preserve during
.Cm unpopulate .
.It Ar snapshot
Location of snapshot for the
.Cm snapshot
action.
.It Ar portscvs
Where to get a ports snapshot for the
.Cm checkout_ports
action.
