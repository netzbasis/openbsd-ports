| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To aid development with MSP430 on OpenBSD, a sample Makefile has been
installed into ${PREFIX}/share/examples/msp430/Makefile .

Using the provided Makefile template, $SOURCES will default to
'main.c'. This can be compiled with the default 'all' target, and
uploaded to the device using the 'program' target.
