# officially part of the platform

# Tools:
# Note that the upstream source mentions (in a comment) haddock-2.14.2,
# so does https://www.haskell.org/platform/changelog.html, but that's
# not true. The haddock shipped with ghc is 2.14.3, and in fact, 2.14.2
# doesn't compile with ghc-7.8.4, so we just use 2.14.3 here and in the
# haddock port.
RUN_DEPENDS +=	devel/cabal-install=1.18.0.5 \
		devel/alex=3.1.3 \
		devel/happy=1.19.4 \
		devel/haddock,-lib=2.14.3 \
		devel/haddock=2.14.3 \
		devel/hscolour=1.20.3

# Haskell platform has haddock commented out, because it comes with ghc,
# but this is not the case for our ghc package.
