| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To disable anti-aliasing (xft) set GDK_USE_XFT=0 in the environment.

Plugins
=======
Seamonkey looks for plugins in ~/.mozilla/plugins and
${LOCALBASE}/lib/mozilla/plugins.
If the environment variable MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH is specified, this
location will be overridden.

Internationalization
====================
There are packages containing internationalizations for all supported
languages. To use Seamonkey in your language, install one of the 
seamonkey-i18n-* packages and start Seamonkey. If you are not asked for 
confirmation of activation of the language pack, go to 
Tools->Add-ons manager->Languages and click 'activate' on your language 
pack. Then go to
Edit->Preferences->Appearance and select your favorite Language/Content 
in the 'User Interface Language' pull down menu. Restart Seamonkey.

Debugging
=========
If you encounter crashes, you might want to build the debug FLAVOR of
this package, and run seamonkey inside gdb, so that you can gather
debugging logs and traces (for all threads !).
Bug reports without that information will be ignored.
