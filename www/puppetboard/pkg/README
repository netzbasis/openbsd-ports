+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

puppetboard has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

Please be aware that this is still highly experimental software and
may not be production ready.

Configuration
-------------
You can configure the PuppetDB host and port through
${INSTDIR}/puppetboard/default_settings.py
Please note that there is currently no SSL support. It is therefore
recommended you run puppetboard on the same host as PuppetDB is running.

PuppetDB
--------
Puppetboard will only function when PuppetDB is available. PuppetDB
can be installed with:

    pkg_add puppetdb

Starting puppetboard
--------------------

By default Puppetboard will bind to 127.0.0.1:8000, to adjust this
puppetboard_flags will need to be set in /etc/rc.conf.local. Please refer to the
gunicorn documentation for the available options.
