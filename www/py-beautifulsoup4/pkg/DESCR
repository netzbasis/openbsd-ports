Beautiful Soup is a Python library for pulling data out
of HTML and XML files. It works with your favorite parser
to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and
modifying the parse tree.  Beautiful Soup 3 is no longer
being developed, and Beautiful Soup 4 is recommended for
all new projects.
