+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you encounter strange problems relating to bookmarks, downloads,
window placement, toolbars, history, or other settings, it is
recommended that you create a new profile and attempt to
reproduce the problem before filing bugs.  To create a new profile,
start Firefox with the -ProfileManager switch, e.g.
firefox -ProfileManager, and click "Create Profile".

If Firefox doesn't start at all, try starting it with -safe-mode
switch, which disables extensions and themes for your session.

Using mailto: links
===================
To enable mailto: links in Firefox to open in your mail program,
you may have to set a mailto protocol handler. Type "about:config"
in Firefox's URL text field.  Type "mailto" in the filter.  If there
is a string called "network.protocol-handler.app.mailto", its value
names the application for mailto URLs. If present, right click,
choose Modify, and enter the path to your mail program, e.g.,
"${LOCALBASE}/bin/thunderbird" or "${LOCALBASE}/bin/kmail" (other
programs may work, but these two have been tested).  If absent,
right click, choose New String. Set the name to
"network.protocol-handler.app.mailto" and the value to the path to
your mailer.

Plugins
=======
Firefox looks for plugins in ~/.mozilla/plugins and
${TRUEPREFIX}/lib/mozilla/plugins.
If the environment variable MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH is specified, this
location will be overridden.

Debugging
=========
If you encounter crashes, you might want to build the debug FLAVOR of
this package, and run firefox inside gdb, so that you can gather
debugging logs and traces (for all threads!).
Bug reports without that information will be ignored.

HTML5 audio/video support
=========================
For a full multimedia experience, such as playing MP3 audio or MPEG
videos, install the "ffmpeg" package. It will be used at runtime if
firefox finds it.

# pkg_add ffmpeg

KerberosV support
=================
To use Kerberized Firefox, first manually install the "heimdal" package
and configure the Kerberos client.

Firefox will load the libraries at runtime if required. On OpenBSD, they
are installed in a non-standard location; to allow Firefox to find them,
either set LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LOCALBASE}/heimdal/lib in your environment
(possibly via a shell alias or wrapper script if you only want to
set this for Firefox), or modify 'shlib_dirs' in /etc/rc.conf.local.

To instruct Firefox to use Kerberos for specific domains, open
'about:config' and modify the following key:

network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris: .example.com

Multi-processus (e10s)
======================
Firefox has a multi-processus feature (https://wiki.mozilla.org/Electrolysis),
currently not enabled by default as of 49, but if you want to test/enable it
you can:
- create a new about:config pref named browser.tabs.remote.force-enable
  and set it to true
- set browser.tabs.remote.autostart to true

Restart the browser, and check about:support - it should say '1/1 (Enabled by
user)' next to 'Multiprocess Windows'.
