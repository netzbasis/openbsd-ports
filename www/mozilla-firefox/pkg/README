| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you encounter strange problems relating to bookmarks, downloads,
window placement, toolbars, history, or other settings, it is
recommended that you create a new profile and attempt to
reproduce the problem before filing bugs.  To create a new profile,
start Firefox with the -ProfileManager switch, e.g.
firefox -ProfileManager, and click "Create Profile".

If Firefox doesn't start at all, try starting it with -safe-mode
switch, which disables extensions and themes for your session.

To disable anti-aliasing (xft) set GDK_USE_XFT=0 in the environment.

Using mailto: links
===================
To enable mailto: links in Firefox to open in your mail program,
you may have to set a mailto protocol handler. Type "about:config"
in Firefox's URL text field.  Type "mailto" in the filter.  If there
is a string called "network.protocol-handler.app.mailto", its value
names the application for mailto URLs. If present, right click,
choose Modify, and enter the path to your mail program, e.g.,
"${LOCALBASE}/bin/thunderbird" or "${LOCALBASE}/bin/kmail" (other
programs may work, but these two have been tested).  If absent,
right click, choose New String. Set the name to
"network.protocol-handler.app.mailto" and the value to the path to
your mailer.

Plugins
=======
Firefox looks for plugins in ~/.mozilla/plugins and
${TRUEPREFIX}/lib/mozilla/plugins.
If the environment variable MOZ_PLUGIN_PATH is specified, this
location will be overridden.

Debugging
=========
If you encounter crashes, you might want to build the debug FLAVOR of
this package, and run firefox inside gdb, so that you can gather
debugging logs and traces (for all threads!).
Bug reports without that information will be ignored.

H.264 support
=============
Due to licensing reasons, you have to manually install the
gstreamer1-plugins-libav package to play H.264 videos.
