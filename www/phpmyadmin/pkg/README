| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

phpMyAdmin has been installed into ${INSTDIR}.

If using Apache, you can make this accessible to clients by enabling
the configuration file:

    # ln -s ../modules.sample/phpmyadmin.conf /var/www/conf/modules/
    # /etc/rc.d/apache2 restart

By default, this sets an alias for /phpMyAdmin and restricts access
to connections coming from localhost.
It also restricts access from search engine bots.

If you need to allow wider access, after considering security
implications, edit /var/www/conf/modules.sample/phpmyadmin.conf
and restart Apache.

You can check that you have a working installation by accessing:
http://localhost/phpMyAdmin/index.php

SECURITY WARNING
================
Be aware that phpMyAdmin is a frequently attacked target due to a
history of security problems.  You are advised to restrict access to
trusted workstations or access it on localhost via an SSH tunnel.
