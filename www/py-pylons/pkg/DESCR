The Pylons web framework is aimed at making webapps and large
programmatic website development in Python easy. Several key points:

* A framework to make writing web applications in Python easy
* Utilizes a minimalist, component-based philosophy that makes it
  easy to expand on
* Harness existing knowledge about Python

***** Pylons is now in maintenance-only mode. *****

The Pylons web framework has merged with repoze.bfg into Pyramid, and is
now in maintenance-only mode. You may submit a pull request or issue,
then respectfully request of the maintainers to accept it and make a
release.

It's highly recommended that new projects start with the new
merged web framework, Pyramid.
