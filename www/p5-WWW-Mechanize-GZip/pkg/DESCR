The WWW::Mechanize::GZip module tries to fetch a URL by requesting
gzip-compression from the webserver.

If the response contains a header with 'Content-Encoding: gzip', it
decompresses the response in order to get the original (uncompressed)
content.

This module will help to reduce bandwith fetching webpages, if supported
by the webeserver. If the webserver does not support gzip-compression,
no decompression will be made.

This modules is a direct subclass of WWW::Mechanize and will therefore
support any methods provided by WWW::Mechanize.

The decompression is handled by Compress::Zlib::memGunzip.

There is a small webform, you can instantly test, whether a webserver
supports gzip-compression on a particular URL:
