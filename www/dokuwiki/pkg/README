| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dokuwiki has been installed into ${INSTDIR}.

With Apache, AllowOverride settings on the ${INSTDIR} directory,
and protection for various directories are required.

You can configure this as follows:
    # ln -sf ${PREFIX}/conf/modules.sample/dokuwiki.conf \
        ${PREFIX}/conf/modules

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
    # ln -s ../dokuwiki /var/www/htdocs/dokuwiki
(make sure you use a relative symlink since Apache is chrooted)

Proceed to complete the installation by opening install.php in your
browser. If you are upgrading your installation, don't forget to
remove install.php.
