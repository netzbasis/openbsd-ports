| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Mozilla Sync server is now installed, and sample configuration files are in
${SYSCONFDIR}/mozilla-sync/sync.conf and ${SYSCONFDIR}/mozilla-sync/production.ini

Basic configuration
===================

You have to set the fallback_node URL in ${SYSCONFDIR}/mozilla-sync/sync.conf
to the full url of the vhost you'll use for Sync server. Note that it
won't work in a subdir, ie it can be http://example.com:5000/ or
http://sync.example.com/ but NOT http://example.com/sync/.

Running the Sync server
=======================

You can start/stop the server through the mozilla_sync rc.d(8) script.
By default it listens on port 5000 (configurable in
${SYSCONFDIR}/mozilla-sync/production.ini). If you don't mind running on
a non-standard port, the configuration is over and you can point your
Firefox clients to it. Otherwise, if you want to use a standard port
and hostname, you'll need to proxy the requests to the sync server.
For that you can use the following VirtualHost definition in httpd.conf
(be sure to enable the proxy module):

<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerAdmin root@example.com
        ServerName  sync.example.com
        ProxyRequests Off
        ProxyPass / http://localhost:5000/
        ProxyPassReverse / http://localhost:5000/
</VirtualHost>

The equivalent for nginx.conf is:

server {
        server_name sync.example.com;
        listen      80;
        listen      [::]:80;
        location / {
                proxy_pass      http://127.0.0.1:5000;
                proxy_redirect  default;
        }
}

These examples use HTTP; in production it is recommended that you
use HTTPS to avoid passwords being sent in clear-text.

Once running, go to sync.example.com/weave-password-reset, if you
see a webform it's running fine. (This is just a test, don't try and
reset your password yet).

Configuring the clients
=======================

Now follow the steps in
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-set-up-firefox-sync, and
dont forget to use your custom server url. Setup other devices with the
'pair a device' code (note that this communicates with the mozilla JPAKE
server at https://setup.services.mozilla.com/ to discover the url of
your sync server, if you want to avoid that use the 'i don't have the
device with me' method with the recovery key) wait a while, and see
other firefoxes history in awesome bar or other tabs in about:sync-tabs.

https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/how-do-i-manage-my-firefox-sync-account
has more information on how to manage your sync data.
The server provides convenience urls at:
http://sync.example.com/weave-delete-account
http://sync.example.com/weave-password-reset

If you encounter a sync error, check that you really did configure
fallback_node before starting the server.
