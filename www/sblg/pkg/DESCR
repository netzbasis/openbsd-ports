sblg is a utility for creating static blogs: it knits together articles and
templates, generating static HTML files and Atom feeds. It's built for use
with make(1), as blogs depend upon articles, etc. No markdown, no "CMS", no
CGI, no PHP. Just a simple tool for pulling data from articles and
populating templates. sblg(1) is an ISC licensed ISO C utility that depends
only on libexpat. (Where "simple" encompasses Atom feeds, multi-language
support, tag filtering, etc.)
