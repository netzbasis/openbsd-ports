Piwik has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

You should point this to the DocumentRoot of your web-server:
   # ln -s ../piwik /var/www/htdocs/piwik

You will also need to enable gd and pdo_mysql extensions
and proceed to complete the installation by reading the online
documentation. Which can be found at:
http://piwik.org/docs/installation/

You can ensure you have a working install by accessing:
http://<localhost>/piwik/
