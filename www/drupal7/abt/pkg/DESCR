ABT (Access by Term) is a module that controls node access based
on relationship between node->term<-user where taxonomy terms allow
for hierarchical content access control.

To use, add a "term reference" field to the content type(s) and the user.
Just make sure to use the exact same field for content checking permissions
to happen.
