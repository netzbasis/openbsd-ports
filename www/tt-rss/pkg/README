| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

tt-rss has been installed into ${INSTDIR}

You should point this to the document root of your web-server:
   # cd /var/www/htdocs && ln -s ../tt-rss .
(make sure you use a relative symlink for chrooted servers)

and proceed to complete the installation by reading the online
documentation. Which can be found at:
http://tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-rss/wiki/InstallationNotes

Database Setup
==============
You'll need to create a database user and a database, then fill the db
with the schema provided in ${INSTDIR}/schema. Then you'll need to
configure the database access in ${INSTDIR}/config.php.

Update feeds
============
You need to choose an update method for the feeds as explained on
http://tt-rss.org/redmine/projects/tt-rss/wiki/UpdatingFeeds

It is advised to run the update daemon through the provided
tt_rss_update rc.d script or you can choose to run the update process
as www user from a cronjob:

*/5	*	*	*	*	sudo -u www ${INSTDIR}/update.php -feeds

Finally you can ensure you have a working install by accessing:
http://<hostname>/tt-rss/
