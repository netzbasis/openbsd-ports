To completely deinstall the opengroupware package you
need to perform these steps as root:

	rm -f ${VARBASE}/www/conf/modules/opengroupware.conf
        and edit ${VARBASE}/www/conf/httpd.conf
        remove the line: LoadModule ngobjweb_module

Do not do this if you plan on re-installing the opengroupware
package at some future time.
