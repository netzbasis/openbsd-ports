Optional dependencies
=====================

Ansible ships with many bundled modules and scripts, some of which may
have external dependencies which are not installed by default as a
run-time dependency of Ansible. In such events Ansible will notify
the user of the missing dependency.

py-cryptography may be installed to speed-up certain cryptographic
operations performed by ansible-vault.
