Optional dependencies
=====================

Ansible ships with many bundled modules and scripts, some of which may
have external dependencies which are not installed by default as a
run-time dependency of Ansible. In such events Ansible will notify
the user of the missing dependency.

Note that py-paramiko is required for managed nodes that don't support
the OpenSSH ControlPersist configuration. Such as RHEL 6 and various
network devices (Junos, IOS, NX-OS, ASA, etc).

Additionally py-cryptography may be installed to speed-up certain
cryptographic operations performed by ansible-vault.
