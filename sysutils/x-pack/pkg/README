| Running Elastic X-Pack on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

${FULLPKGNAME} is a repack of the official Elastic X-Pack distribution
with some workarounds required to make it work on OpenBSD:

 - Fixed shell path in bash scripts
 - Disabled Kibana reporting plugin due to node.js version incompatibility

Useless content such as Windows *.bat scripts and platform-specific binaries
for Chrome, Phantomjs and ML-related files was removed.

Limitations
===========
1. Elastic products are not supported on OpenBSD, leaving X-Pack usable for
either testing (with 30-days trial license) or for setups with features
provided by free basic license (annual, renewable via e-mail registration).
Support matrix: https://www.elastic.co/support/matrix#matrix_os
Subscription types: https://www.elastic.co/subscriptions
2. Machine learning and reporting features are not available for OpenBSD.

X-Pack Installation for Elasticsearch
=====================================
X-Pack plugin installation script requires ${SYSCONFDIR}/elasticsearch
folder to be owned by user who installs X-Pack, i.e. _elasticsearch.

In OpenBSD, ${SYSCONFDIR}/elasticsearch is owned by root._elasticsearch.
To avoid errors, change ${SYSCONFDIR}/elasticsearch owner to _elasticsearch
before X-Pack installation and change it back to root after:

	# rcctl stop elasticsearch
	# chown _elasticsearch ${SYSCONFDIR}/elasticsearch
	# doas -u _elasticsearch \
		${LOCALBASE}/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-plugin install \
		file://${TRUEPREFIX}/share/x-pack/${FULLPKGNAME}.zip
	# chown root ${SYSCONFDIR}/elasticsearch

Machine learning features are not available for OpenBSD, so after X-Pack plugin
installation, uncomment the following line in ${SYSCONFDIR}/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml:

	#xpack.ml.enabled: false

Start elasticsearch and generate default passwords:

	# rcctl start elasticsearch
	# doas -u _elasticsearch \
		${TRUEPREFIX}/elasticsearch/bin/x-pack/setup-passwords auto

Note the passwords for elastic and kibana users.

X-Pack Installation for Kibana
==============================
Stop Kibana and install X-Pack:

	# rcctl stop kibana
	# doas -u _kibana \
	    ${LOCALBASE}/kibana/bin/kibana-plugin install \
	    file://${TRUEPREFIX}/share/x-pack/${FULLPKGNAME}.zip

Add credentials generated in step 2 to ${SYSCONFDIR}/kibana/kibana.yml:

	elasticsearch.username: "kibana"
	elasticsearch.password:  "<pwd>"

Start Kibana:

	# rcctl start kibana

Log in as the built-in elastic user with the auto-generated password
from step 2.

X-Pack Installation for Logstash
================================
Stop Logstash and install X-Pack:

	# rcctl stop logstash
	# doas -u _logstash \
		${LOCALBASE}/logstash/bin/logstash-plugin install \
		file://${TRUEPREFIX}/share/x-pack/${FULLPKGNAME}.zip

Add credentials generated in step 2 to ${SYSCONFDIR}/logstash/logstash.yml:

	xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.username: logstash_system
	xpack.monitoring.elasticsearch.password: <pwd>
