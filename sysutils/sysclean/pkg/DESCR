sysclean is a ksh(1) script designed to the administrator to help removing
obsoletes files between upgrades.

sysclean works by comparing a reference root directory against currently
installed files.  It consideres standard system files, configuration
files installed by default, and packages files.

sysclean doesn't remove any files on the system. It only reports obsoletes
filenames or packages using obsoletes libraries.
