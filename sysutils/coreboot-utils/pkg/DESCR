coreboot is an extended firmware platform that delivers a lightning fast and
secure boot experience on modern computers and embedded systems. As an Open
Source project it provides auditability and maximum control over technology.

While it is not (yet) possible to build coreboot firmware on OpenBSD, this
package contains the following utilities to work with existing images:

* cbmem      CBMEM parser to read e.g. timestamps and console log
* ectool     Dumps the RAM of a laptop's Embedded/Environmental Controller (EC)
* ifdtool    Extract and dump Intel Firmware Descriptor information
