Loading index template
======================
If Filebeat will be shipping directly into ElasticSearch, the index
template needs to be loaded into the cluster first:

    curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_template/filebeat?pretty' \
    	 -d@${SYSCONFDIR}/filebeat/filebeat.template.json

Replace `localhost` and `9200` if required by your setup.

Migrating from Filebeat 1.x
===========================
The configuration file layout has changed from beats 1.x to 5.x,
please refer to the upstream documentation at
https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/libbeat/5.0/upgrading-1-to-5.html

Migrating from Logstash Forwarder
=================================
When migrating from logstash-forwarder to filebeat, please review this
document on how to adapt your configuration:

    https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/current/migrating-from-logstash-forwarder.html
