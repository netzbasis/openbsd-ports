| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You will need to add

    csh -cf '${PREFIX}/sbin/runsvdir-start &'

to /etc/rc.local in order to have runit start at boot.

The service directory has moved back from ${LOCALSTATEDIR}/service to
/service.  To keep on using ${LOCALSTATEDIR}/service, a symlink is
enough:

  # ln -s /var/service /

Read ${PREFIX}/share/doc/runit/upgrade.html on update.
