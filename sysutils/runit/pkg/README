+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You will need to add

    csh -cf '${PREFIX}/sbin/runsvdir-start &'

to /etc/rc.local in order to have runit start at boot.

The service directory has moved from /service to ${LOCALSTATEDIR}/service.

With this version the runsvctrl, runsvstat, svwaitdown, and svwaitup
programs no longer are being installed. The functionality of these
programs has been incorporated into the sv program.

Read ${PREFIX}/share/doc/runit/upgrade.html on update.
