rr (random run) runs a command with randomized arguments.

Basically,

$ rr mpv *.mp4
will give you a true shuffle, that doesn't play the same file twice.

There are more options:

$ rr xv -nolimit -- *
allows you to specify options that won't be jumbled.

$ rr -n 500 -x '.*.pdf' xv -nolimit -- *
will run xv several times on all files in the current directory
except those matching '.*.pdf', limiting each run to 500 parameters.

See the manpage for details.
