Programming on-board devices
============================
One common use of flashrom is to programme an on-board flash device
(e.g. for updating devices on the mainboard or a PCI device attached
to the machine you're running it on).

This requires the ability to write directly to memory, which is
INSECURE. Therefore, OpenBSD denies it under normal operating
conditions.

If you have decided to accept the risks of using this software,
it is advised to reboot into *single user mode* ("boot -s"),
mount necessary filesystems (mount -a -t nonfs), flash and
reboot.

In single user mode, the system securelevel(8) does allow
access to write directly to system memory, and importantly
network services and other third-party software will usually
not be running at the time.

flashrom also supports some external programming devices via USB;
in those cases it can be run from a normal boot.
