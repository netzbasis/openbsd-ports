Netshot maintains a history of the configurations of your network devices.
While doing so it builds an inventory of IP addresses, MAC addresses,
serial numbers and other things. It checks the saved configurations and
discovered versions against the defined policy and marks devices that are
not compliant. It is compatibles with many network devices out of the
box and is easy to extend.
