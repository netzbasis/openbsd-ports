cs is a program for concurrently executing ssh(1) or scp(1) on a number of
hosts.  It is intended to automate running remote commands or copying files
between hosts on a network. Public key authentication is used for establishing
passwordless connection.

Note that the utility has been renamed from cs to go-cs to prevent a conflict
with the www/clearsilver port.
