Logstash should be started with it's own uid/gid _logstash, since this user
has all necessary filesystem permissions. For example, if you want to check
the configuration, use doas(1):

    # doas -u _logstash ${TRUEPREFIX}/logstash/bin/logstash -t

Or if you want to manage plugins:

    # doas -u _logstash ${TRUEPREFIX}/logstash/bin/plugin install <plugin>

Elastic X-Pack is available as separate OpenBSD package:

	# pkg_add x-pack
