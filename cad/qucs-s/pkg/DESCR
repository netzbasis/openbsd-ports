Qucs-S is a spin-off of the Qucs cross-platform circuit simulator (which
uses its own simulation kernel Qucsator). "S" letter indicates SPICE.

The purpose of the Qucs-S subproject is to use free SPICE circuit
simulation kernels with the Qucs GUI.

Qucs-S is not a simulator by itself, but it requires to use a simulation
backend (Ngspice is recommended).
