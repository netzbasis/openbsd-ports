If you want to get quotes updates, install the p5-Finance-Quote and
p5-Crypt-SSLeay packages.

Encryption feature isn't finished and doesn't work - KMyMoney can't request
passphrase. If you accidentally ended up in encrypting the only data you have,
just decrypt it manually with gnupg. The decrypted file will be a normal
KMyMoney database file, only uncompressed. See more details in KMyMoney
documentation.
