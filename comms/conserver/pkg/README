| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As installed, conserver is running as user _conserver. If you want to
use conserver to manage local serial ports, you have to add _conserver
to group dialer in /etc/group:

  dialer:*:117:_conserver

This is not necessary if you only use it to log and control access to
terminal servers over the network rather than on local serial ports.

If you have upgraded from a previous version of the OpenBSD package which
ran as root, you will need to change permissions/ownership on log files to
ensure that the _conserver user can write to them, e.g.:

  chown _conserver /var/log/conserver /var/log/consoles/*

Note that you will probably also want to arrange rotation of the above
log files (via newsyslog(8) or another method).
