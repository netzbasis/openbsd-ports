| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

As installed, conserver is running as user _conserver. If you want to
use conserver to manage local serial ports, you have to add _conserver
to group dialer in /etc/group:

  dialer:*:117:_conserver

This is not necessary if you only use it to log and control access to
terminal servers over the network.
