This is a set of experimental ports to build xenocara as components
They reach out into ${XSRCDIR} to get access to the component.

Each package is fake ! the real tarball is built under
${PACKAGE_REPOSITORY}/${ARCH}/components

the "package" will install stuff under /usr/local/libdata/base/*
- the name of the tarball
- and the corresponding list (manifest)

when the package first installs, it copies the name of the tarball under
/var/db/components

so that when it gets reinstalled, there's no need to extract the same files
again.

The common part to that is in bootstrap/

There are two meta packages:
- xenocara/meta, to build stuff that requires xenocara to be there
- xenocara/release, to build the remaining critical components and create 
the X release
