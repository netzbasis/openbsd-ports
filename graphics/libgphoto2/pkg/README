Since USB reading of your camera will be handled by libusb, you need to 
allow the user access to the corresponding USB endpoint. To do so, find
where your camera is attached to by using:
    $ usbdevs -v
then change the ownership accordingly.

e.g.
Controller /dev/usb0:
<...>
addr 03: 04e8:6860 SAMSUNG, SAMSUNG_Android
         high speed, power 96 mA, config 2, rev 4.00, iSerialNumber 9a0cef4c
         driver: umodem0
         driver: ugen0

# chown <username> /dev/ugen0.* /dev/usb0

The reason we are changing the user and not the group is that only 
<username> can access it. 

To preserve your changes after a system update, use rc.local(8).

Alternatively, hotplugd(8) attach/detach scripts can automate this.
