Ruby Extensions
===============

Although there are currently no ruby extension scripts shipped with
Inkscape, users are free to write their own. If you wish to write ruby
extensions, then please install Ruby ${MODRUBY_REV}.

Icon Bug
========

Inkscape is not very resilient to missing icon sets and can crash (for
example when opening file->"document properties"). If you specify a custom
icon theme in your ~/.gtkrc-2.0, then make sure that this icon set is
actually installed.
