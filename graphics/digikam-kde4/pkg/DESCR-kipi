KIPI (KDE Image Plugin Interface) is an effort to develop a common
plugin structure for Digikam, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and GwenView.
Its aim is to share image plugins among graphic applications. Kipi
is based on the old digiKam plugins implementation.

Kipi plugins are additional functions for the KDE Images Managment
Host Programs. They can add extra menus and shortcuts, and extend
the host programs features. You can install as many or as few as
you like, from within host programs.

More information on using and enabling the plugins you want is
available in the host program handbook.
