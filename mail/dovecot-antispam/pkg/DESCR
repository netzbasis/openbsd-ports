The Dovecot antispam plugin works with an external anti-spam system to
help automate training as spam/non-spam. It watches designated folders for
messages being moved into or out of them, and feeds them to the anti-spam
software for training. Specific support exists for dspam and crm114; other
software is accommodated by piping to a command, forwarding the messages
to specific email addresses for training, or writing to files.
