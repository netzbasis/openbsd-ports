Setup with httpd from OpenBSD base system
=========================================
By default, femail will use `localhost' for smtphost. 
httpd(8) inside the chroot(2) will NOT be able to use the system
/etc/hosts or /etc/resolv.conf. One will need to populate /var/www/etc/hosts 
and/or /var/www/etc/resolv.conf in the chroot(2) environment.

Additionally, one may create a custom femail.conf; see femail(8).

If you're using femail with PHP inside a chroot jail, be aware that
PHP's built-in "mail" function uses popen(), which requires /bin/sh.
