Mailpile is an e-mail client, a search engine and a personal webmail
server. Mailpile is an easy way to encrypt your e-mail. Mailpile is
software you run yourself, on your own computer.

Mailpile is an effort to reclaim private communication on the
Internet. A project to rescue our personal lives from the proprietary
cloud and prevent our conversations from being strip-mined for
corporate profit and government surveillance. Mailpile is taking
e-mail back.
