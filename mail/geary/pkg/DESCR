Geary is an email client built for the GNOME desktop environment. It
allows you to read and send email with a simple, modern interface. The
first time Geary is launched, it will prompt for your account
information. Note that your email password is stored securely in the
Gnome Keyring. Geary will then begin downloading messages in your
inbox. Only the most recent messages will be downloaded. To continue
reading email, scroll down in the message list and more email will be
fetched.
