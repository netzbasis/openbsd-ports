Mutt is a small but very powerful text-based mail client for Unix-like
operating systems. Features include support for multiple mailbox formats
(including IMAP, POP3, mbox, MMDF, MH, Maildir), MIME/RFC2047, message
threading, encryption and signing with PGP/GPG and S/MIME, and many
operations can use regular expressions. It's highly customizable with
many options for colours, key bindings, display formats etc.

Flavors:
	gpgme      - build with support for GPGME, simplifying use with GnuPG:
                     "set crypt_use_gpgme = yes" in muttrc, and run gpg-agent:
                     "export GPG_TTY=$(tty); eval $(gpg-agent --daemon)" 
	sasl	   - build with SASL authentication support
	slang	   - use S-Lang instead of curses for screen handling
	compressed - build with compressed folder support
		     (see: http://www.spinnaker.de/mutt/compressed/)
	sidebar	   - adds a sidebar that has a folder list
		     (see: http://thomer.com/mutt/)
