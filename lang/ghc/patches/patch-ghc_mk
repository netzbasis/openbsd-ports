$OpenBSD: patch-ghc_mk,v 1.8 2013/07/18 21:43:23 kili Exp $

Include utf8-string and xhtml for now, because of dependencies.
Including *any* of those INTREE_ONLY_PACKAGES in the ghc packages
wasn't the brightest idea I had (see mtl library hell). The two
libraries left can and will be replaced by separate ports when
needed.

Fix the bindist-list (for building the bootstrapper); without this,
gtar creates an archive which our tar can't extract.
