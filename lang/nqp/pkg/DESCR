This is "Not Quite Perl" -- a compiler for quickly generating PIR
routines from Perl6-like code.  The key feature of NQP is that it's
designed to be a very small compiler (as compared with, say, perl6
or Rakudo) and is focused on being a high-level way to create
compilers and libraries for virtual machines (such as the Parrot
Virtual Machine).  Unlike a full-fledged implementation of Perl 6,
NQP strives to have as small a runtime footprint as it can, while
still providing a Perl 6 object model and regular expression engine
for the virtual machine.
