Railo is a high-performance open-source CFML engine with good compatibility
with other CFML engines.  Most sites can be ported to Railo with little
effort, and all major CFML frameworks support Railo out of the box.

CFML ("ColdFusion Markup Lanuage") is a server-side web scripting language
that augments standard HTML files with database commands, conditional
operators, high-level formatting functions, and other elements to produce
web applications. ColdFusion Components (CFCs), CFML's version of objects,
allow for separation of business logic from presentation.

The language uses either HTML-like tags (good for intermixing with HTML
text) or with a JavaScript-like "cfscript" syntax.  If the many built-in
functions (including imaging, Lucene search, S3 storage and PostgreSQL/
MySQL/MSSQL drivers) aren't enough, it is also fairly easy to call
native Java classes from your appications.
