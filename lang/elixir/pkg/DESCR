Elixir is a programming language built on top of the Erlang VM. As
Erlang, it is a functional language built to support distributed,
fault-tolerant, non-stop applications with hot code swapping.

Elixir is also dynamic typed but, differently from Erlang, it is also
homoiconic, allowing meta-programming via macros. Elixir also supports
polymorphism via protocols (similar to Clojure's), dynamic records and
provides a reference mechanism.

Finally, Elixir and Erlang share the same bytecode and data types. This
means you can invoke Erlang code from Elixir (and vice-versa) without
any conversion or performance hit. This allows a developer to mix the
expressiveness of Elixir with the robustness and performance of Erlang.
