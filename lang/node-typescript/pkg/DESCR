TypeScript is a language for application-scale JavaScript development.
It is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to clean, simple
JavaScript code which runs on any browser, in Node.js, or in any other
ES3-compatible environment. TypeScript offers classes, modules, and
interfaces to help you build robust components.
