From the upstream documentation, "Memcached does not spend much, if any,
effort in ensuring its defensibility from random internet connections.
So you must not expose memcached directly to the internet, or otherwise
any untrusted users. Using SASL authentication here helps, but should
not be totally trusted."

In particular, if listening on UDP (upstream's current default),
memcached can act as a bandwidth amplification vector.  

The default setting in this package is now to listen on localhost only.
If listening on the network, memcached should be firewalled and UDP should
be disabled unless absolutely necessary.

To change to listening on all IP addresses (upstream's default), but leaving
UDP disabled:

# rcctl set memcached flags '-u _memcached -U 0'

To change to listening on a unix socket (local machine only) and allowing
access only from members of group _memcached:

# rcctl set memcached flags '-u _memcached -s /var/run/memcached/sock -a 0660'
