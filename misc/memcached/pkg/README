From the upstream documentation, "Memcached does not spend much, if any,
effort in ensuring its defensibility from random internet connections.
So you must not expose memcached directly to the internet, or otherwise
any untrusted users. Using SASL authentication here helps, but should
not be totally trusted."

The default setting in this package is now to listen on localhost only.

To change to listening on all IP addresses (upstream's default), assuming
you have already firewalled appropriately:

# rcctl set memcached flags '-u _memcached'

An alternative is to listen on a unix socket in /var/run/memcached/sock,
granting write permissions to users in group _memcached.

# rcctl set memcached flags '-u _memcached -s /var/run/memcached/sock -a 0660'
