libde265 is an open source implementation of the h.265 video codec.
It is written from scratch and has a plain C API to enable a simple
integration into other software.

libde265 supports WPP and tile-based multithreading and includes SSE
optimizations. The decoder includes all features of the Main profile and
correctly decodes almost all conformance streams.

The library comes with two example programs:

dec265, a simple player for raw h.265 bitstreams. It serves nicely as an
example program how to use libde265.

sherlock265, a Qt-based video player with the additional capability to
overlay some graphical representations of the h.265 bitstream (like
CU-trees, intra-prediction modes).

Example bitstreams can be found, e.g., at this site:
