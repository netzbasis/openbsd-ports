ReadyMedia (formerly known as MiniDLNA) is simple media server software,
written in C, with the aim of being fully compliant with DLNA/UPnP-AV clients
(televisions, tablets, etc).

This is Gleb Smirnoff's fork of original project by Justin Maggard, created
temporarily due to low activity of main project.
