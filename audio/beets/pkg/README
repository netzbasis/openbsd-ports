Optional plugins
================
This package includes several optional plugins for beets; they need to be
enabled by adding the name to the 'plugins:' line in your config.yaml file,
and many require additional packages to be installed.

Here are a few common examples.

discogs: The discogs plugin extends the autotagger's search capabilities
to include matches from the Discogs database. Add 'discogs' to the plugins:
line in ~/.config/beets/config.yaml. You will need to login and obtain an
OAuth token for Discogs; if updating from an older version and this no
longer works, you may need to "rm ~/.config/beets/discogs_token.json"
and login again.

chroma: This plugin is for acoustic fingerprinting. Install py-acoustid
and add 'chroma' to the plugins: line.

replaygain: This plugin adds support for ReplayGain, a technique for
normalizing audio playback levels. Install the mp3gain or aacgain packages
and add 'replaygain' to the plugins: line.

web: The web plugin lets your browse and listen to your library through
an HTML5 compatible browser. Install the py-flask package and add 'web'
to the plugins: line.

See http://beets.readthedocs.org/en/latest/plugins/ for a complete list.
