abcde is a front end command-line utility (actually, a shell script)
that grabs tracks off a CD, encodes them to ogg or mp3 format, and
tags and names them with data from a CDDB server, all in one go.

To use mp3 format, install the lame package, and set OUTPUTTYPE=mp3 in
${SYSCONFDIR}/abcde.conf (copy this to ~/.abcde.conf for per-user configuration).
