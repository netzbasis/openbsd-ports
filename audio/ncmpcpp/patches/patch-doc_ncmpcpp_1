 .SH "BINDINGS"
 When ncmpcpp starts, it tries to read user's bindings from ~/.ncmpcpp/bindings and $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ncmpcpp/bindings files. If no bindings file is found, ncmpcpp uses the defaults. An example bindings file with the default values can be found usually in /usr/share/doc/ncmpcpp (exact location may depend on used distribution or configure prefix).
