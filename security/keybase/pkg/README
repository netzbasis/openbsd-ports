Keybase and KBFS
================

The keybase package includes two daemons which you need to run as regular user
to access to the most of the Keybase features. "keybase" is the main daemon and
you can control it with "keybase ctl".

KBFS is a distributed and encrypted filesystem. Also, it's used as a remote for
the encrypted git repos. You need to run "kbfsfuse" to enable the access to
KBFS. Despite the name the daemon will not use FUSE, so you can run it
without root access.

The "kbfsfuse" daemon will wait until the keybase daemon is ready. You can
start both in parallel without worrying about the order. Upstream uses these
commands to autostart the daemons (the logs are saved in ~/.cache/keybase):

- keybase --debug --use-default-log-file service --auto-forked
- kbfsfuse -debug -log-to-file

Using the Keybase services requires an account on keybase.io. If you don't have
an account, use "keybase signup" to register a new account and "keybase login"
to provision every new computer.

If you have a weak connection to the internet, you can speed up the access to
the KBFS files with an encrypted local cache: "keybase fs sync enable
/keybase/private/youruser".
