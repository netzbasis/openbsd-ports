Please see the ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/doc/sudo/UPGRADE file for important
information about upgrading from a previous version of sudo.

Important user-visible changes compared to the version of sudo that
used to be in OpenBSD base (1.7.2p8) include:

 o The tty_tickets sudoers option is now enabled by default.
   To restore the old behavior (single time stamp per user),
   add a line like:
	Defaults !tty_tickets
   to sudoers.

 o  The HOME and MAIL environment variables are now reset based on the
    target user's password database entry when the env_reset sudoers option
    is enabled (which is the case in the default configuration).  Users
    wishing to preserve the original values should use a sudoers line like:
	Defaults env_keep += HOME
    to preserve the old value of HOME and
	Defaults env_keep += MAIL
    to preserve the old value of MAIL.
