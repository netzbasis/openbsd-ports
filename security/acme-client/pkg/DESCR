acme-client is a client for the ACME protocol used by the Let's Encrypt CA.
It uses isolated processes for various operations - network code doesn't
have access to the filesystem, etc - this is enforced by pledge(2).

acme-client is present in the OpenBSD base system. This package is for the
original version, which uses a different configuration interface (CLI rather
than configuration file). It also supports the DNS-01 challenge type which
is not currently available in the version in the base system.

The executable is installed as "eacme-client".
