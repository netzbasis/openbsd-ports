OpenSSL is an open-source toolkit implementing the Secure Sockets
Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols as well as a
full-strength general purpose cryptography library.

This package is not intended for general-purpose use in OpenBSD -
it is present to provide support for applications which cannot be made
compatible with LibReSSL (mostly due to use of removed APIs), and for
test/comparison purposes.
