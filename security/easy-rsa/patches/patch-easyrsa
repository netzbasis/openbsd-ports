$OpenBSD: patch-easyrsa,v 1.2 2018/01/13 01:23:46 sthen Exp $

Makes extensive use of passing environment variables and using
$ENV:: in OpenSSL config files. Bizarrely, parsing of these config
files is done by the library rather than the openssl(1) command
line tool, and this was removed from LibreSSL, so easy-rsa won't
work with LibreSSL without extensive changes, so patching to use
OpenSSL from ports instead.
