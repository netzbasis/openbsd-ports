pecl-libsodium is a wrapper for Libsodium, which is a modern library for
encryption, decryption, signatures, password hashing and more. A user guide
is available at https://paragonie.com/book/pecl-libsodium.

The pecl-libsodium PHP extension provides a low-level interface; you may
be interested in the Halite library (https://paragonie.com/project/halite)
which builds on this to provide a higher-level interface.
