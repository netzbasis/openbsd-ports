kQOAuth is a library written in C++ for Qt that implements the OAuth
1.0 authentication specification RFC 5849 and is based on QOAuth
library.  However, QOAuth's approach is improved in some ways.

kQOAuth main features:
  * Easy integrated solution for retrieving user authentication and
    access token.
  * No external dependency to QCA.
  * Convenient signals that can be used for easy OAuth authorization
    process handling.
  * Access to request objects that will wrap request signing and
    network access, but still gives possibility for detailed control
    of the authentication process for easier integration to existing
    application logic.
