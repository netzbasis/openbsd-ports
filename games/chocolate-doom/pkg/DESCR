Chocolate Doom is a portable branch of the classic doom.exe experience
from the days of DOS. The author, Simon Howard, has worked to ensure
Chocolate Doom, which is nothing more than a directly modified version
of the released iD Software source code, has zero changes that affect
gameplay, look, or feel, and also re-created a DOS-like setup program to
configure the game much like the original setup.exe.  The project also
maintains versions of the engine for Heretic, Hexen, and Strife.

Chocolate Doom provides:
  chocolate-doom          - the Doom executable
  chocolate-doom-setup    - the Doom setup executable
  chocolate-heretic       - the Heretic executable
  chocolate-heretic-setup - the Heretic setup executable
  chocolate-hexen         - the Hexen executable
  chocolate-hexen-setup   - the Hexen setup executable
  chocolate-strife        - the Strife executable
  chocolate-strife-setup  - the Strife setup executable
  chocolate-server        - server for up to 4-player net games


Due to the port re-implementing the original games as closely as
possible, all original game PWADs and demos work flawlessly. Other
original features include a PC-speaker driver, just like the DOS
PC-speaker driver, and a working -left and -right network command
parameter system for the 'surround display' setup that was
obtainable with the original DOS executables over an IPX network.
