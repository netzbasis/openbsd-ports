To play the game you will need an original Doom, Ultimate Doom,
Doom II, Final Doom, Heretic, Hexen, or Strife IWAD. Place the
doom.wad, doom2.wad, plutonia.wad, tnt.wad, heretic.wad, hexen.wad,
strife1.wad + voices.wad or all of the above in
${PREFIX}/share/doom/ to play.  The shareware will also work.

If multiple IWADs are installed, you may specify the one you want to
play via the -iwad command-line parameter e.g.

  $ chocolate-doom -iwad doom.wad
  $ chocolate-heretic -iwad heretic1.wad (heretic shareware)

The Doom Shareware IWAD is available in the doomdata package.

Run `chocolate-gamename-setup' to generate a configuration file to your
liking.
