Postal
======
Postal requires the original game files from Postal 1 to work properly.
These can come from an original CD or from GOG.com.

If using the GOG.com version, you must extract the files from
setup_postal_1.0_-_28.11.2016_(9399).exe using the innoextract package.
The files will be in a directory named app. You must keep this
directory, though it can be renamed and moved to a location of your
choosing, and you can delete everything else that is extracted from the
exe, such as the tmp directory.

After extracting and optionally renaming and moving the game files
directory, you will need to cd into the game files directory. Using the
dos2unix package, you must strip the MS-DOS newlines from the POSTAL.INI
and res/levels/postal\ plus\ realms.ini files. You should do this before
running the postal1 binary for the first time.

Your working directory must be the game files directory when launching
the postal1 binary.

To go to the next level, press F1 after completing your objective.
