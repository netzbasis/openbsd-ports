This package contains controller software for Ubiquiti UniFi access points,
switches, gateways and phones.

This is version 5.6, a maintenance release which maintains support for
the Broadcom-based first generation of 802.11ac access points (UAP-AC,
UAP-ACv2, UAP-AC-Outdoor) and the Atheros-based but limited-memory
Picostation M2.

This 5.6 branch will be supported upstream until November 2018.

The other earlier 11n access points (Atheros-based) are still supported
in the normal versions of the controller.
