This package contains controller software for Ubiquiti UniFi access points,
switches, gateways and phones.

This is version 5.6, a long-term support release which maintains support for
the Broadcom-based first generation of 802.11ac access points. Other earlier 
11n access points (Atheros-based) are still supported in the normal versions
of the controller.
