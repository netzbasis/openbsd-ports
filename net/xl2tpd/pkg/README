| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This port is in early stages, and in general for LNS ("server") use it is
recommended to use npppd(8) instead, however it is useful if you wish
to use OpenBSD as an L2TP client (LAC).

xl2tpd can be controlled either by using xl2tpd-control, or by writing
simple commands to a fifo (you may be familiar with this style from
isakmpd), e.g.:

  echo '[command] [config_name]' > /var/run/xl2tpd/l2tp-control

Where [command] is one of:

  c    connect; may be followed by authname and password
  d    disconnect
  r    (disconnect and) remove

You must send the 'c'onnect command to actually bring up a session;
configuring it and starting the daemon is not sufficient.

xl2tpd makes a connection via L2TP, but uses pppd(8) to carry out most
operations; therefore most PPP-related configuration is done via pppd's
configuration files; for an example of how to configure this, see
${TRUEPREFIX}/share/examples/xl2tpd/ppp-options.xl2tpd. You will also need
to add the _xl2tpd user to the group 'network' in /etc/group in order to
allow it to start pppd.

Also note that a free ppp(4) interface must exist before xl2tpd brings
up a connection; you could create an /etc/hostname.ppp0 file simply
containing the word "up".
