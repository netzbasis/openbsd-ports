BIND is open source software that implements the Domain Name System
(DNS) protocols for the Internet. It is a reference implementation
of those protocols, but it is also production-grade software,
suitable for use in high-volume and high-reliability applications.

Flavours:
	geoip - build BIND with support for geolocation using the GeoIP api.
