This standalone script allows you to migrate the basic Icinga 1.x object
configuration into native Icinga 2 configuration objects. This project
will be merged into the upstream CLI once there is a stable release.
Meanwhile it acts as standalone helper tool for migrating to Icinga 2.

You are highly advised to read the Icinga 2 Migration documentation
and understand the new dynamic configuration syntax. Check the manual
migration hints in the documentation (http://docs.icinga.org/icinga2/latest/).
