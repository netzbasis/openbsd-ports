Icinga monitors network resources such as servers, routers, switches,
applications and services and notifies administrators or responsible
persons. Current status information, historical logs and reports can
all be accessed via a web browser.

This package provides Icinga 1.x, the legacy version, which is a fork
of Nagios. New installations should use Icinga 2 (a different codebase).
Both versions support the extensive collection of standard monitoring
plug-ins that also work with Nagios and other similar software.
