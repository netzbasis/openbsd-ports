Notes about Icinga2
===================

Icinga2 is not a drop-in replacement for Icinga (or Nagios)!

Read the "Migration from Icinga 1.x" and the "Differences between Icinga
1.x and 2" sections in the documentation.

A migration script (https://github.com/Icinga/icinga2-migration) exists,
but it has several limitations (see the Known Caveats section).


Getting Started
===============

The main documentation for Icinga2 is provided in markdown format.
See ${LOCALBASE}/share/doc/icinga2/markdown or at
http://docs.icinga.org/icinga2/latest/doc.

The included sample configuration carries out some simple checks
on the local machine; these should work as-is.

You may check your configuration file format before starting Icinga:

   $ sudo -u _icinga ${TRUEPREFIX}/sbin/icinga2 daemon -C

This will parse all configuration files and warn about any problems
which have been identified.

To enable automatic startup on boot for icinga2, add it to the pkg_scripts
line in /etc/rc.conf.local.

To start icinga2, reboot or start it manually:

   $ sudo ${RCDIR}/icinga2 start


Chroot Considerations
=====================

If you're using OpenBSD's default chroot environment for nginx, some files
will need to be moved inside the jail and symbolic links created.

   mkdir -p ${PREFIX-cgi}/etc ${PREFIX-cgi}/var/log
   mv ${SYSCONFDIR} ${PREFIX-cgi}/etc/
   ln -s ${PREFIX-cgi}/etc/icinga2 ${BASESYSCONFDIR}
   mv /var/icinga2 ${PREFIX-cgi}/var/
   ln -s ${PREFIX-cgi}/var/icinga /var
   mv /var/log/icinga2 ${PREFIX-cgi}/var/log/
   ln -s ${PREFIX-cgi}/var/log/icinga2 /var/log

To display times in your local timezone, you will also need to provide
a suitable /var/www/etc/localtime; due to the chroot, a symbolic link cannot
be used here, instead the file can be copied:

   cp /usr/share/zoneinfo/Antarctica/South_Pole ${PREFIX-cgi}/etc/localtime

Web User-Interfaces
===================

A new web-based user interface for Icinga2 is in beta, instructions will
be added to this file in the future. Until its release you can use the
classic or the API based user interfaces, please consult the upstream
documentation and the README for icinga 1.x.
