XXX rewrite marketing blurb

Icinga monitors network resources such as servers, routers, switches,
applications and services and notifies administrators or responsible
persons.

Icinga 2 is a parallel development branch to Icinga 1. Written from
scratch, it builds on the success of Icinga 1 and deals with shortcomings
inherited from Nagios as a fork.

* Easy to install with soft link activation of functions and packages
* Multithreaded and very fast: Capable of thousands of checks per second
* Intuitive to configure, using new object-based, template-driven format
* Easy to extend with native support for Livestatus and Graphite
* Cluster-enabled for distributed monitoring out of the box

Icinga 2 ships with all the functionality modern monitoring environments
need, while delivering unmatched performance, scalability and interoperability.
From Livestatus and performance data writers to IDO and cluster capabilities,
the above features are currently available in Icinga 2, with API / Agents on
the drawing board.
