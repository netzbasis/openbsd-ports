Icinga monitors network resources such as servers, routers, switches,
applications and services and notifies administrators or responsible
persons.

Icinga 2 is a parallel development branch to Icinga 1. Written from
scratch, it builds on the success of Icinga 1 and deals with shortcomings
inherited from Nagios as a fork.
