DHCPv6-PD (Prefix Delegation)
=============================
As OpenBSD doesn't yet support DHCPv6 in the base OS, one common use of
this package is to request Prefix Delegation from an ISP, which hands you
one or more routable IPv6 subnet that can be assigned to interfaces
facing your local network.

Here is a sample configuration achieving this, fetching addresses over the
pppoe0 interface and assigning it to multiple local networks.

-- -- -- -- -- --
ipv6only
noipv6rs
duid
persistent
option rapid_commit
require dhcp_server_identifier

# disable running any hooks; not typically required for simple DHCPv6-PD setup
script /usr/bin/true

# List interfaces explicitly so that dhcpcd doesn't touch others
allowinterfaces pppoe0 em0 vlan3 vlan5

interface pppoe0
	# the following two lines tell dhcpcd to do router solicitation
	# itself. don't use them if using "inet6 autoconf" (slaacd)
	ipv6rs
	ia_na 1

	# request prefixes from the provider to use for downstream networks
	ia_pd 2 em0/1 vlan3/2 vlan5/3
-- -- -- -- -- --

In normal cases, you would use rad(8) to advertise these prefixes to
clients. Put the following in /etc/rad.conf:

-- -- -- -- -- --
interface em0
interface vlan3
interface vlan5
-- -- -- -- -- --

And enable rad(8):

    # rcctl enable rad
