libmesode is a minimal XMPP library written in C. libmesode is a fork of
libstrophe for use in Profanity (ports/net/profanity).

Reasons for forking:

    Remove Windows support
    Support only one XML Parser implementation (expat)
    Support only one SSL implementation (OpenSSL)

This simplifies maintenance of the library when used in Profanity.

Whilst Profanity will run against libstrophe, libmesode provides extra TLS
functionality such as manual SSL certificate verification.
