In order to perform queries over DNSCrypt, using OpenDNS as a
resolver, the easiest way is change your /etc/resolv.conf file to:

nameserver 127.0.0.1
lookup file bind
options edns0

But DNSCrypt does _not_ cache queries. So the recommended way to use
it is as a forwarder for a DNS cache like Unbound.
Both can safely run on the same host.

A list of non-OpenDNS resolvers providing DNSCrypt service is available
at ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/dnscrypt-proxy/dnscrypt-resolvers.csv, and can be
selected by using an rc.conf.local(8) line like the following:

dnscrypt_proxy_flags=-R dnscrypt.eu-nl
