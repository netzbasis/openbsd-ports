In order to perform queries over DNSCrypt, the easiest way is change
your /etc/resolv.conf file to:

nameserver 127.0.0.1
lookup file bind
options edns0

But DNSCrypt does _not_ cache queries. So the recommended way to use
it is as a forwarder for a DNS cache like Unbound.
Both can safely run on the same host.

A list of resolvers providing DNSCrypt service is available at
${TRUEPREFIX}/share/dnscrypt-proxy/dnscrypt-resolvers.csv.
Choose one (there is no default) and configure it, for example:

rcctl enable dnscrypt_proxy
rcctl set dnscrypt_proxy flags -R dnscrypt.eu-nl
rcctl start dnscrypt_proxy
