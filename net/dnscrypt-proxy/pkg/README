| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

dnscrypt-proxy listens for DNS queries on a local address and forwards
them to a DNSCrypt resolver over an encrypted channel.

To use this package, two things are required.

Firstly, validate that ${SYSCONFDIR}/dnscrypt-proxy.toml fits your needs,
and start the daemon:

# rcctl enable dnscrypt_proxy
# rcctl start dnscrypt_proxy

Secondly, set /etc/resolv.conf to perform queries from dnscrypt-proxy:

nameserver 127.0.0.1
lookup file bind

Note: If fetching your IP address dynamically, dhclient(8) will normally
update resolv.conf with network-provided DNS servers. This can be avoided
by using "ignore domain-name, domain-name-servers;" in /etc/dhclient.conf.
