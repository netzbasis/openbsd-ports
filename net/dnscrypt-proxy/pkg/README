| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

dnscrypt-proxy listens for DNS queries on a local address and forwards
them to a DNSCrypt resolver over an encrypted channel.

To use this package, several things are required.

First, ensure that ${SYSCONFDIR}/dnscrypt-proxy.toml fits your needs.

Uncomment 'server_names' to have a smaller set of public resolvers to be
used for load balancing. If this line is commented, all registered
servers matching the require_* filters will be used for load balancing.

Note the load balancing strategy, controlled by 'lb_strategy'. It can be
set to one of the following values:
  - 'fastest' (always pick the fastest server in the list)
  - 'p2' (randomly choose between the top two fastest servers)
  - 'ph' (randomly choose between the top fastest half of all servers)
  - 'random' (just pick any random server from the list)

'p2' is the default option, and you may change this. For more
information, see
https://github.com/jedisct1/dnscrypt-proxy/wiki/Load-Balancing-Options

Second, start the daemon:

# rcctl enable dnscrypt_proxy
# rcctl start dnscrypt_proxy

Finally, set /etc/resolv.conf to perform queries from dnscrypt-proxy:

nameserver 127.0.0.1
lookup file bind

Note: If your IP address is dynamically fetched, dhclient(8) will normally
update resolv.conf with network-provided DNS servers. This can be avoided
by using "ignore domain-name, domain-name-servers;" in /etc/dhclient.conf.
