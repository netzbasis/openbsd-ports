Basic configuration
===================

Smokeping is split into two main parts, the daemon (running the probes
and updating RRD files) and the part responsible for generating website
graphs.

Edit ${SYSCONFDIR}/smokeping/config (at least add some hosts to
monitor) and enable the daemon:

    rcctl enable smokeping
    rcctl start smokeping

The simplest method to generate graphs is as static HTML and images.
There is no possibility to zoom into graphs interactively from the
browser, but it is easy to configure and might be quite acceptable.
Do this by running 'smokeping --static=/path/to/html-dir' from cron.

Alternatively it will run as a CGI/FastCGI script with a web server.
Smokeping itself doesn't work well with a chroot jail, but the script
can be run as a persistant process outside the jail, and communicate
with a chroot'ed webserver via FastCGI. The included smokeping_fcgi
rc script will start Smokeping ready to communicate over a FastCGI
UNIX socket /var/www/run/smokeping.sock. If you wish to use this
method, enable this:

    rcctl enable smokeping_fcgi
    rcctl start smokeping_fcgi

And configure your web server to access it - here is a sample
configuration section for use with nginx:

    location ~ /smokeping/smokeping.cgi$ {
	fastcgi_pass	unix:run/smokeping.sock;
	fastcgi_split_path_info ^(/cgi-bin/[^/]+)(.*);
	fastcgi_param	PATH_INFO $fastcgi_path_info;
	fastcgi_param	SCRIPT_FILENAME $fastcgi_script_name;
	include		fastcgi_params;
    }

Other probe types
=================

Smokeping is commonly used to perform ICMP monitoring using fping,
but also includes probes to monitor other protocols. Some require
additional dependencies:

 RADIUS:	   p5-Authen-Radius
 TelnetIOSPing:	   p5-Net-Telnet
 OpenSSHEOSPing:   p5-Net-OpenSSH, p5-IO-Pty
 OpenSSHJunOSPing: p5-Net-OpenSSH, p5-IO-Pty
 AnotherDNS:	   p5-Net-DNS
 LDAP:		   p5-ldap, p5-IO-Socket-SSL
