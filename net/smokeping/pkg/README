| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic configuration
===================

Symlink the sample apache config file into the modules directory:

# ln -s ../modules.sample/smokeping.conf /var/www/conf/modules/

Edit ${SYSCONFDIR}/smokeping/config (at least add some hosts to
monitor).

To have smokeping start at boot time, add "smokeping" to rc_scripts
in /etc/rc.conf.local, e.g.:

rc_scripts="${rc_scripts} smokeping"

To use probes other than the most common fping probe, you may need to
install additional packages:

 RADIUS:	   p5-Authen-Radius
 TelnetIOSPing:	   p5-Net-Telnet
 OpenSSHJunOSPing: p5-Net-OpenSSH
 AnotherDNS:	   p5-Net-DNS
 LDAP:		   p5-ldap (and p5-IO-Socket-SSL for starttls)

chroot considerations
=====================

By default OpenBSD's httpd uses chroot(2) so that only files
within /var/www are accessible; this doesn't work with smokeping's
CGI scripts (at least without major work copying large parts of
Perl and Smokeping into the chroot jail). Simpler options are:

- Disable chroot by setting the following in /etc/rc.conf.local:
    httpd_flags=-u

- Create static HTML and images rather than allowing them to be
viewed/zoomed; do this by running 'smokeping --static=/path/to/html-dir'
from cron.

Alternatively, Smokeping now uses FastCGI, so it would be possible
to pass the requests across from a jailed httpd to a copy of Smokeping
running outside the jail. Please contact the port maintainer if you
have a working configuration for this which you would be willing to
share.


Remote sensors
==============

This feature requires that the userid running the webserver is
able to create new .cache files and write to existing .rrd files
under /var/db/smokeping. After adjusting the configuration file
and starting smokeping to generate the rrd files, adjust the
group ownership and permissions accordingly, e.g.

# chgrp -R www /var/db/smokeping/*
# chmod -R g+rwX /var/db/smokeping/*

This will need to be repeated if additional hosts are monitored
via remote sensors.
