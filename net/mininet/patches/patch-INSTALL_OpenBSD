+Mininet installation (and general) notes for OpenBSD
+----------------------------------------------------
+
+Currently, the only option is native installation.
+
+
+### Prerequisites
+
+This Mininet port relies on the native OpenFlow switch and controller,
+`switch(4)` and `switchd(8)`, respecitvely - meaning that it assumes that you
+are using OpenBSD 6.1. It also makes use of `doas` instead of `sudo`.
+
+
+### Installation
+
+If it hasn't been already, install `git`:
+
+    doas pkg_add git
+
+Fetch the repo and checkout this branch:
+
+    git fetch https://github.com/akoshibe/mininet.git
+
+The install script, `install.sh`, can be used to install the Mininet core
+libraries along with its dependencies. It must be generated first:
+
+    cd mininet
+    ./configure
+    util/install.sh -a #or with flag -n
+
+`install.sh -h` will give you all available options.
+
+To test the installation:
+
+    doas mn --test=pingall
+
+This will create a two-host, one-switch network and ping across the hosts.
+Alternatively, a `pingall` can be run from the CLI for a similar sanity check:
+
+    doas mn
+    mininet> pingall
+
+
+### Removal
+
+The Mininet core files can be uninstalled with the same install script:
+
+    util/install.sh -u
+
+This essentially undoes `install.sh -n` minus the package dependencies,
+which is the same as `doas make uninstall`.
+
+
+### Limitations and Bugs
+
+* The `iperf` CLI command is pretty unstable, and can hang or kill X.
+
+* The number of hosts (or nodes within their own 'namespaces') is limited to 255,
+  the highest ID that can be given to an rdomain.
+
+* Only the basic network elements (Node, Switch, Link, Controller, Host) are
+  supported, i.e. there are no NAT or any resource/bandwidth-limited elements.
+  Additionally, no work has been done to try to support non-native components such
+  as Open vSwitch or the many controllers (NOX, POX, Ryu...)
+
+* The `dpctl` CLI command (mapped to `switchctl`) isn't constrained to one
+  switch, so it will print the same text per switch.
