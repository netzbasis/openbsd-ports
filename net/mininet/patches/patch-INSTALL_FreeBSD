+Mininet installation notes for FreeBSD
+--------------------------------------
+
+Currently, the only option is native installation.
+
+### Prerequisites
+
+This Mininet port relies heavily on VIMAGE. VIMAGE is supported by FreeBSD 8.0
+and later, so anything past 8.0 should work - with the caveat that Mininet has
+only been tested so far on 10.3 and newer.
+
+First and foremost, If it hasn't been already, the kernel must be recompiled with
+the VIMAGE option in order for `jail` to be able to take advantage of virtual
+network stacks (`vnet`s). A sample kernel configuration file, `VIMAGEMOD`, can
+be found under `util/` of this repository. It also contains comments that describe
+the minimum steps for recompiling a kernel.
+
+To use resource limited hosts, `rctl` must be enabled. Add to /boot/loader.conf:
+
+    kern.racct.enable=1
+
+The system must be rebooted for this to take effect, so it's best to add this
+before building a VIMAGE kernel (as you're rebooting anyways).
+
+### Installation
+
+If they haven't been already, install `git` and `sudo`:
+
+    pkg install git-lite sudo
+
+Fetch the repo and checkout this branch:
+
+    git fetch https://github.com/akoshibe/mininet.git
+
+The install script, `install.sh`, can be used to install Mininet, Open
+vSwitch, and Ryu along with their dependencies. It must be generated first:
+
+    cd mininet
+    ./configure
+    util/install.sh -a #or with flags -nvy
+
+The script uses `pkg` to install the dependencies, so this should take just a
+minute or so (plus or minus confirming installation, and network speed).
+
+Next, start Open vSwitch (if not started):
+
+    sudo service ovsdb-server onestart
+    sudo service ovs-vswitchd onestart
+
+The following lines can be added to /etc/rc.conf so that they start with
+system startup/restart:
+
+    ovsdb_server_enable="YES"
+    ovs_vswitchd_enable="YES"
+
+Finally, test the installation:
+
+    sudo mn --test=pingall --controller=ryu
+
+This should take about five or six seconds, a good chunk of which is waiting
+for Ryu to start up. Alternatively, a `pingall` can be run from the CLI for a
+similar sanity check with less waiting:
+
+    sudo mn --controller=ryu
+    mininet> pingall
+
+### Removal
+
+The Mininet core files can be uninstalled with the same install script:
+
+    util/install.sh -u
+
+This essentially undoes `install.sh -n`, minus the package dependencies.
