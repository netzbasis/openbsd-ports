oRTP - a Real-time Transport Protocol (RFC3550) stack under LGPL.
It implements the RFC3550 (RTP) with a easy to use API with high and
low level access and features:
  * Support for multiples profiles, AV profile (RFC3551) being
    the one by default.
  * A packet scheduler for sending and recieving "on time", according
    to their timestamp. Scheduling is optionnal, RTP sessions can remain
    not scheduled.
  * Mutiplexing I/O, so that hundreds of RTP sessions can be scheduled
    by a single thread.
  * Adaptive jitter algorithm for a receiver to adapt to the clockrate
    of the sender.
  * Supports part of RFC2833 for telephone events over RTP.
  * The API is well documented using doxygen.
  * RTCP messages sent periodically since 0.7.0 (compound packet
    including sender report or receiver report + SDES).
  * An API to parse incoming RTCP packets.
