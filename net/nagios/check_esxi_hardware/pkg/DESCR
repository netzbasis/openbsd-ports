This script is a Nagios plugin to monitor the hardware of ESX and ESXi
servers. It can also be used as standalone script to check the hardware -
Nagios isn't necessary to run it.

N.B. ESXi 5.0u1 hosts respond very slowly to hardware status queries
(http://kb.vmware.com/kb/2016538), as a workaround you may increase the
service_check_timeout in Nagios or Icinga.
