| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Note that most broctl(8) commands must be run as root.

Post-install steps
==================

Before starting bro(8) for the first time, the "interface" must be properly
configured under:
    ${SYSCONFDIR}/bro/node.cfg

And the configuration and policies must be installed and deployed by running:
    broctl deploy
This command will run broctl(8) with the check, install, and restart arguments.

It's also recommended to enable housekeeping tasks by adding the following
entry into root's crontab(5):
*/5	*	*	*	*	${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/broctl cron

See https://www.bro.org/sphinx/quickstart/index.html for details.
