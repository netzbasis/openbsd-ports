To enable bitlbee, add a line such as the following to /etc/inetd.conf:

127.0.0.1:6667    stream  tcp     nowait _bitlbee ${TRUEPREFIX}/sbin/bitlbee bitlbee

inetd(8) must be reloaded (or started). To enable it at boot, the
following line needs to be added to rc.conf.local(8):
inetd_flags=

If a libpurple flavored bitlbee port was previously used, be aware that
"classic" bitlbee cannot support all protocols supported with purple
library.  Remove lines for all protocol accounts unsupported by
"classic" bitlbee in users' xml configuration files in ${DB_DIR}.
