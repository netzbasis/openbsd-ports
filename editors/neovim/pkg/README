Why is the Escape Key Not Working Right?
========================================

If you use Neovim under tmux, you are likely being bitten by a libtermkey bug.
Read the libtermkey package README for a workaround.

Migrating from Vim to Neovim
============================

Note that in Neovim some paths are different from traditional vim. The config
dir is ~/.config/nvim, and the main config file is ~/.config/nvim/init.vim. You
can symlink your existing traditional vim config and directory to the new
paths, and this will work.

The first time you invoke nvim, run ':CheckHealth' to see what else you might
need to do to migrate.
