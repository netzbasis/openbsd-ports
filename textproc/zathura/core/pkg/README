With version 0.1.0, zathura has been rearchitectured to use plugins to
handle various file types. If you want to view PDF files, you'll need
to install either zathura-pdf-poppler or zathura-pdf-mupdf. Similarly,
you can install zathura-cb for comicbook support, zathura-djvu to view
DJVU files, and zathura-ps to view PostScript files.
