Even though roff is a general-purpose typesetting system, the OpenBSD
groff port is focussed on formatting ports(7) manuals that mandoc(1)
is unable to handle.  To make groff output as similar as possible to
mandoc output, the following two groff features have been disabled by
default: adjustment of text to the right margin and hyphenation.

If you want to use groff for serious typesetting work and need these
features, please set up your own troff(1) configuration file:

  mkdir ~/.tmac
  cp ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/groff/1.21/tmac/troffrc ~/.tmac/
  export GROFF_TMAC_PATH=~/.tmac

In your new troffrc file, uncomment these two lines to enable
hyphenation:

.do hpf hyphen.us
.do hpfa hyphenex.us

Delete these three lines to enable the roff `ad' request, such that
documents can adjust text to the right margin:

.ad l
.de ad
..

In case you dislike the default string "OpenBSD ports" in mdoc(7)
manual footers, you can add the the line

.ds default-operating-system my fancy system

to the file ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/groff/site-tmac/mdoc.local.
But don't do that on a machine you intend to build ports(7) on.


To suit the taste of OpenBSD developers, two mdoc(7) formatting
details have been changed with respect to the upstream distribution:

 * Title lines use an n-dash, not an m-dash between the manual page
   name and the manual page description.

 * The .Pa macro always produces emphasized text,
   even in the FILES section.

To allow automated output comparisons with mandoc(1), the bullet
character \(bu has been changed to just "o" instead of a "+"
superimposed on top of an "o".
