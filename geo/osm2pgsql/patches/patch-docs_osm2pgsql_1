 Only for slim mode: Use up to num many MB of RAM for caching nodes. Giving osm2pgsql sufficient cache
 to store all imported nodes typically greatly increases the speed of the import. Each cached node
 requires 8 bytes of cache, plus about 10% \- 30% overhead. For a current OSM full planet import with
 its ~ 3 billion nodes, a good value would be 27000 if you have enough RAM. If you don't have enough
