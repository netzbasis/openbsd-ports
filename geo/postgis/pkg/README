Postgis requires pthreads in order to work. OpenBSD does not allow
shared objects that link to pthreads to be opened via dlopen if the
executable program does not link to pthreads. So to use postgis, you
must ensure that libpthread is loaded before PostgreSQL.
The easiest way to do this is adding the following login class
to login.conf:

postgresql:\
	:setenv=LD_PRELOAD=libpthread.so:\
	:tc=daemon:

the PostgreSQL rc.d(8) script will take care of launching the daemon
with that login class.
