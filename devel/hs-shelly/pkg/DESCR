Shelly provides convenient systems programming in Haskell, similar
in spirit to POSIX shells. Shelly:

* is aimed at convenience and getting things done rather than being
  a demonstration of elegance

* has detailed and useful error messages

* maintains its own environment, making it thread-safe

* is modern, using Text and system-filepath/system-fileio
