pythondialog is a Python wrapper for the UNIX dialog utility originally
written by Savio Lam and later rewritten by Thomas E. Dickey. Its
purpose is to provide an easy to use, pythonic and as complete as
possible interface to dialog from Python code.

This version is a backport of pythondialog to Python 2. Unless you
really have to use Python 2, you should go to the pythondialog home page
and download the reference implementation which, at the time of this
writing (May 2015) and for the forseeable future, is targeted at Python 3.
