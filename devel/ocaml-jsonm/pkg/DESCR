Jsonm is an OCaml non-blocking streaming codec to decode and
encode the JSON data format. It can process JSON text
without blocking on IO and without a complete in-memory
representation of the data.

The uncut codec also processes whitespace and (non-standard)
JSON with JavaScript comments.

Jsonm is made of a single module and depends on Uutf . It is
distributed under the BSD3 license.
