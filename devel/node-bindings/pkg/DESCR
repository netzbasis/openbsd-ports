This is a helper module for authors of Node.js native addon modules. It
is basically the "swiss army knife" of require()ing your native module's
.node file.

Throughout the course of Node's native addon history, addons have ended
up being compiled in a variety of different places, depending on which
build tool and which version of node was used. To make matters worse,
now the gyp build tool can produce either a Release or Debug build, each
being built into different locations.

This module checks all the possible locations that a native addon would
be built at, and returns the first one that loads successfully.
