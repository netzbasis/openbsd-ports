pefile is a multi-platform Python module to parse and work with Portable
Executable (aka PE) files. Most of the information contained in the PE
headers is accessible as well as all sections' details and their data.

The structures defined in the Windows header files will be accessible as
attributes in the PE instance. The naming of fields/attributes will try
to adhere to the naming scheme in those headers. Only shortcuts added
for convenience will depart from that convention.
