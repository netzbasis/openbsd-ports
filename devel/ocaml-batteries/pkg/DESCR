***OCaml Batteries Included***, or just ***Batteries***, is a
community-maintained foundation library for your OCaml projects.
Batteries

* defines a standard set of libraries which may be expected on every
  compliant installation of OCaml;

* organizes these libraries into a hierarchy of modules, with a single
  source of documentation; and

* provides a consistent API for otherwise independent libraries.
