| Running ${PKGSTEM} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

On OpenBSD, the BuildBot package has an associated _buildslave user
for running the slave.  The default slave directory is expected to be
found in ${HOMEDIR}.  Before being run for the first time, the
slave directory must be initialized.  This is done as follows:

    # su -m _buildslave -c \
        "buildbot-worker create-worker ${HOMEDIR} <master> <name> <passwd>"
