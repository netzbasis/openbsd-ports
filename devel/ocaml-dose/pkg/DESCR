Dose is a library and a collection of tools to perform a large spectrum
of analysis on package repositories.  Dose manipulates packages
repositories from different sources such as Debian, Rpm, Eclipse/Osgi
and OpenCSW / Solaris.  The library core does not make any assumption of
the semantic and syntax of any specific packages systems and is based
on the Cudf format.
