distcc
======
To spawn compilation jobs on remote hosts, a minimal configuration
such as the following can be used as `~/.distcc/hosts`:

    localhost 192.168.178.13

or `/etc/distcc/hosts` for a system-wide configuration.
For SSH connections prefix hosts with `@` in the host specification.
distcc will run the jobs as the user invoking distcc.

Then set `$CC` to `distcc` to distribute compilation jobs across the
configured nodes.

refer to the Gentoo and Arch Linux wikis. While containing information
specific to their build systems, they do provide good general information:
