Guppy-PE is a library and programming environment for Python, currently
providing in particular the Heapy subsystem, which supports object and
heap memory sizing, profiling and debugging. It also includes a
prototypical specification language, the Guppy Specification Language
(GSL), which can be used to formally specify aspects of Python programs
and generate tests and documentation from a common source.
