Tools for authors of syntactic tools in OCaml 4.02+ (such as ppx
rewriters)

This package is licensed by LexiFi under the terms of the MIT

The tools are installed as a findlib package called 'ppx_tools'.
Executables are thus accessible through the ocamlfind driver (e.g.:
ocamlfind ppx_tools/dumpast).
