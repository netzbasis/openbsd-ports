This module implements bag and set operations on ordered lists. For
the purposes of this module, a "bag" (or "multiset") is a non-decreasing
list, whereas a "set" is a strictly ascending list. Bags are sorted
lists that may contain duplicates, whereas sets are sorted lists
that do not contain duplicates.
