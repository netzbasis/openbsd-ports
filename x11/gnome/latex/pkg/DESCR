GNOME LaTeX is a LaTeX editor for the GNOME desktop, previously named LaTeXila.
GNOME LaTeX permits to concentrate on the content and the structure of the
document instead of being distracted by its presentation.

To help the writing of the LaTeX markup, auto-completion is available as well as
menus and toolbars with the principal commands. New documents are created from
templates. There are buttons to compile, convert and view a document in one
click. And projects containing several .tex files are managed easily.

A side panel contains three components: the document structure to easily
navigate in it; lists of symbols to insert them in a document; and a file
browser.

GNOME LaTeX has also other features like the spell-checking, or jumping to the
associated position between the .tex file and the PDF.
