Empathy is able to use several Telepathy connection managers.
By default the following managers are installed with empathy:

  * telepathy-gabble	Jabber/XMPP, GoogleTalk and MSN (Windows Live)
  * telepathy-salut	Zeroconf/Bonjour (link-local)
  * telepathy-idle	IRC

It is also possible to use the protocols supported by Pidgin's libpurple
(Yahoo!, SILC, Facebook, etc) by installing the Haze connection manager
package: "telepathy-haze".
