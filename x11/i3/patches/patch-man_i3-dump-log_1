 i3-dump-log \- dumps the i3 SHM log
 .SH "SYNOPSIS"
 .sp
-i3\-dump\-log [\-s <socketpath>] [\-f]
+i3\-dump\-log [\-hVv]
 .SH "DESCRIPTION"
 .sp
 Debug versions of i3 automatically use 1% of your RAM (but 25 MiB max) to store full debug log output\&. This is extremely helpful for bugreports and figuring out what is going on, without permanently logging to a file\&.
 .sp
 With i3\-dump\-log, you can dump the SHM log to stdout\&.
-.sp
-The \-f flag works like tail \-f, i\&.e\&. the process does not terminate after dumping the log, but prints new lines as they appear\&.
 .SH "EXAMPLE"
 .sp
 i3\-dump\-log | gzip \-9 > /tmp/i3\-log\&.gz
