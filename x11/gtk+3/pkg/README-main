Default theme
=============
The default GTK+ theme engine can be modified by editing:
    ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini
and appending a line similar to:
gtk-theme-name = oxygen-gtk

Some themes are available as packages ("gtk3-*-engine").

Print Preview
=============
By default, GTK+ uses the "evince" command from the evince package to
display a "Print Preview". This can be modified by editing:
    ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini
and appending the following line:
gtk-print-preview-command = epdfview %f

(epdfview can be replaced by any other PDF viewer command like xpdf...)

Note that by default, "evince" will remove the temporary PDF preview
file (/tmp/previewXXXXX.pdf) when done, that might not be the case with
other PDF viewers.
