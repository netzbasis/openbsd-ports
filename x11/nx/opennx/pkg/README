Printing with CUPS
==================
To be able to use the CUPS backend for direct printing from the remote
NX server to the local spooler, you need to install the cups package
and make the following files executable by your user.
    # chmod 555 ${LOCALBASE}/sbin/cupsd
    # chmod 755 ${LOCALBASE}/libexec/cups/backend/ipp

Sharing folder(s) with Samba
============================
To be able to share folders between your local and remote Desktop, the
"samba" package needs to be installed (and properly configured) and its
corresponding daemons started.
