Default theme XXX c/p from x11/gtk+3, does it still work?
=============
The default GTK+ theme engine can be modified by editing:
    ~/.config/gtk-4.0/settings.ini
and appending a line similar to:
gtk-theme-name = oxygen-gtk

Some themes are available as packages ("gtk4-*-engine").

Preview XXX c/p from x11/gtk+3, does it still work?
-------
By default, GTK+ uses the "evince-previewer" command from the evince package to
display a "Print Preview". This can be modified by editing:
    ~/.config/gtk-4.0/settings.ini
and appending the following line:
gtk-print-preview-command = epdfview %f

(epdfview can be replaced by any other PDF viewer command like xpdf...)

Note that by default, "evince" will remove the temporary PDF preview
file (/tmp/previewXXXXXX.pdf) when done, that might not be the case with
other PDF viewers.

CUPS
----
Printing to CUPS requires installing the gtk+4-cups package.
