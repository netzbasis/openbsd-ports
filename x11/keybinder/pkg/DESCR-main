Keybinder is a library for registering global keyboard shortcuts.
It works with GTK-based applications using the X Window System.

This library originates in Tomboy and has been widely reused without
having a separate release. This package has taken the python bindings
from the Deskbar Applet project, and broken it out to a standalone
project. The library was subsequently rewritten in major parts.
