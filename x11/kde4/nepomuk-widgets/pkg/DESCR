Nepomuk is about classification, organisation and presentation of data.
It is not an application, but a component which can be used by
developers within applications.

This is the KDE Meta Data library (not to confuse with KFileMetaData).
It consists of the following parts:
  * The main resource handling centered around Nepomuk2::Resource;
  * The handling of ontologies via classes in the Nepomuk2::Types
    namespace;
  * The desktop Nepomuk2::Query API;
  * nepomuk_facets;
  * Several utility methods and classes.
