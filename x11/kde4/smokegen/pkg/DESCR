SMOKE is a introspective wrapper around the Qt and KDE frameworks.
Legend has it that SMOKE stands for Scripting Meta Object Kompiler
Engine.

Information about all classes and all methods/functions is stored
in cross-referencing tables for fast look-ups. Thereby the whole
API of a wrapped library can be used.

The main purpose of SMOKE is making it easier to write bindings
from scripting languages to Qt and KDE - with an emphasis on ease
of use and flexibility.

This package contains generator used for creating actual wrappers.
