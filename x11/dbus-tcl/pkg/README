| Running ${FULLPKGNAME} on OpenBSD
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

If used with non-threaded Tcl or an executable that is
not linked with libpthread then it will be necessary to
set "LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libpthread.so" in the environment.

As of version 2.0:
The 'dbus-tcl' Tcl package is now called 'dbus'.

Man and doc files dbus-tcl.n and dbus-tcl.html are
now dbus.n and dbus.html, respectively.
All other port files and directories remain 'dbus-tcl'.

Occurrences of [package require dbus-tcl]
should be changed to [package require dbus].
