pl/v8 requires pthreads in order to work.  OpenBSD does not allow
shared objects that link to pthreads to be opened via dlopen if
the executable program does not link to pthreads.  So to use
pl/v8, you must ensure that PostgreSQL links to libpthread.
The easiest way to do this is adding the following login class
to login.conf:

postgresql:\
        :setenv=LD_PRELOAD=libpthread.so:\
        :tc=daemon:
