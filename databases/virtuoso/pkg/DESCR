Virtuoso is a high-performance object-relational SQL database. As
a database, it provides transactions, a smart SQL compiler, powerful
stored-procedure language with optional Java and .Net server-side
hosting, hot backup, SQL-99 support and more. It has all major
data-access interfaces, such as ODBC, JDBC, ADO .Net and OLE/DB.

Virtuoso has a built-in web server which can serve dynamic web pages
written in Virtuoso's web language (VSP) as well as PHP, ASP .net
and others. This same web server provides SOAP and REST access to
Virtuoso stored procedures, supporting a broad set of WS protocols
such as WS-Security, WS-Reliable Messaging and others. A BPEL4WS
run time is also available as part of Virtuoso's SOA suite.

Virtuoso has a built-in WebDAV repository. This can host static and
dynamic web content and optionally provides versioning. The WebDAV
repository is tested to interoperate with WebDAV clients built into
Windows XP, Mac OSX and others and makes Virtuoso a convenient and
secure place for keeping one's files on the net. Further, Virtuoso
provides automatic metadata extraction and full text searching for
supported content types.

OpenLink Virtuoso supports SPARQL embedded into SQL for querying
RDF data stored in Virtuoso's database. SPARQL benefits from low-level
support in the engine itself, such as SPARQL-aware type-casting
rules and a dedicated IRI data type. This is the newest and fastest
developing area in Virtuoso.
