Initial setup
=============

If you are installing MySQL for the first time, you have to create
a default database first. In order to create the database, please run
${TRUEPREFIX}/bin/mysql_install_db

You will need to tune the values in the my.cnf file (examples
available in ${TRUEPREFIX}/share/mysql).

By default, the _mysql user, and so the MySQL processes run in the
login(1) class of "daemon". On a busy server, it may be advisable
to put the _mysql user and processes in their own login(1) class
with tuned resources, such as more open file descriptors etc.

For example, add this to the login.conf(5) file:

        mysqld:\
                :openfiles-cur=1024:\
                :openfiles-max=2048:\
                :tc=daemon:

Rebuild the login.conf.db file if necessary:

	# [ -f /etc/login.conf.db ] && cap_mkdb /etc/login.conf

For larger servers and dedicated database servers, these numbers
and memory limits (e.g. datasize and stacksize) may also need to be
increased. Please report any changes and experiences to the package
maintainers so that we can update this file for future versions.

chrooted daemons and MySQL socket
=================================

For external program running under a chroot(8) to be able to access the
MySQL server without using a network connection, the socket must be
placed inside the chroot.

e.g. httpd(8) or nginx(8): connecting to MySQL from PHP
-------------------------------------------------------
Create a directory for the MySQL socket:

    # install -d -m 0711 -o _mysql -g _mysql /var/www/var/run/mysql

Adjust ${SYSCONFDIR}/my.cnf to put and connect to the MySQL socket
within the chroot:

    [client]
    socket = /var/www/var/run/mysql/mysql.sock

    [mysqld]
    socket = /var/www/var/run/mysql/mysql.sock
