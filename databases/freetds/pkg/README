If you are using FreeTDS from a program which is not linked with the
thread library, you may find that the program fails, possibly reporting
errors like this:

undefined symbol 'pthread_mutex_unlock'

If this occurs, you will need to manually load the pthread shared
library; you can do this by setting "LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/libpthread.so"
in the environment before starting your program.
